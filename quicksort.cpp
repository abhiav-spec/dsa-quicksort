Quicksort Algorithm

Quicksort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm and is based on partitioning of array into smaller subarrays.
 It follows the divide-and-conquer approach where it:

Selects a "pivot" element from the array.

Partitions the array into two subarrays - elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot.
Recursively applies the same process to the subarrays.
This process continues until the entire array is sorted. Quicksort is widely used due to its average-case time complexity of O(n log n), making it one of the fastest sorting algorithms in practice.
